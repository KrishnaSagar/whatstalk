## So, what is whatstalk?
whatstalk is a Chrome extension to monitor user activity in Whatsapp Web. It simply records online history of a user you choose to be monitored.
This project is highly influenced by [whatsapp_stalker](https://github.com/supernova13892/whatsapp_stalker)
and [this gist](https://gist.github.com/parthpower/d0fb6a1196fd8cefebde#whatsapp-on-web-monitor).
